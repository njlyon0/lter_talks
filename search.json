Synthesis skills differ from primary research skills because synthesis requires a focus on collaboration as well as an increased emphasis on quantitative skills. Synthesis Skills for Early Career Researchers (SSECR) is that course and it will be first offered in fall of 2024 to a cohort of ~30 students (about 1 per LTER site). The course materials can be found at lter.github.io/ssecr though they will likely be under construction/revision until late 2024/early 2025.\n\nNCEAS Roundtable (2024)\nInvited to give a presentation at National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the monthly “roundtable” presentation.\n\nRoundtable Slides – Full Screen\n\n\nLTER Community Call (2024)\nMarty Downs and I co-presented at the March LTER Community Call.\n\nCommunity Call Slides – Full Screen"
